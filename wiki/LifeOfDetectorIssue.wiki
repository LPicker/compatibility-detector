#summary Life of a Detector Issue

1. After a detector is developed, a verification process will start. At this stage, the verifier should create a new issue with default labels and 'Detector' label. The subject of the issue should be in format of 'XXNNNN detector_name'.

2. The verifier verifies if the detector can detect compatibility issues accurately, and record the details of the verification.

3. If the verifier finds no false-positive or false-negative, change the status of the issue to 'Done' and exit this process.

4. The verifier adds 'False-Positive' and/or 'False-Negative' labels to the issue if the detector is proofed to have false-positives and/or false-negatives respectively.

5. The verifier can assign the issue to an appropriate detector developer or a developer can also pick the issue.

6. The developer modifies code to fix the issue, or makes decision not to resolve the issue if the fix is too difficult.

7. Go to step 2.
